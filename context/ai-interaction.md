# AI Interaction Guidelines

## Communication

- Be concise and direct
- Explain non-obvious decisions briefly
- Ask before large refactors or architectural changes
- Don't add features not in the project spec
- Never delete files without clarification
- I may write prompts in Ukrainian or Russian. Reply in the language I wrote in.
- Everything written to files is in English: code, comments, specs, context files, current-feature.md, commit messages, README.

## Workflow

This is the common workflow that we will use for every single feature/fix:

1. **Document** - Document the feature in @context/current-feature.md.
2. **Branch** - Create new branch for feature, fix, etc
3. **Implement** - Implement the feature/fix that I create in @context/current-feature.md
4. **Test** - Verify it works (browser for UI, curl or a test for APIs). Add/maintain unit tests for the logic you touch, see [Testing](#testing). Run the typecheck from CLAUDE.md and fix any errors. Run the build before `/feature complete`
5. **Iterate** - Iterate and change things if needed
6. **Commit** - Only after typecheck and tests pass and everything works
7. **Merge** - Merge to main
8. **Delete Branch** - Delete branch after merge
9. **Review** - Review AI-generated code periodically and on demand.
10. Mark as completed in @context/current-feature.md and add to history

Do NOT commit without permission and until typecheck and tests pass. If they fail, fix the issues first.

## Branching

We will create a new branch for every feature/fix. Name branch **feature/[feature]** or **fix[fix]**, etc. Ask to delete the branch once merged.

## Commits

- Ask before committing (don't auto-commit)
- Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.)
- Keep commits focused (one feature/fix per commit)
- Never put "Generated With Claude" in the commit messages

## When Stuck

- If something isn't working after 2-3 attempts, stop and explain the issue
- Don't keep trying random fixes
- Ask for clarification if requirements are unclear

## Code Changes

- Make minimal changes to accomplish the task
- Don't refactor unrelated code unless asked
- Don't add "nice to have" features
- Preserve existing patterns in the codebase
- Don't add dependencies without asking
- Never read or print .env values

## Testing

<!-- /bootstrap adapts this section to the real test runner, config and mocking style. -->

Default: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev), Node environment.

- **Scope: business logic and utilities.** Services, server actions, validation schemas, pure helpers. No component/UI tests unless asked.
- Co-locate tests next to the code as `*.test.ts`.
- Keep tests true units: **no real database, network, or auth**. Mock collaborators with `vi.mock(...)`; define mock objects with `vi.hoisted()` so the hoisted `vi.mock` factory can reference them.
- Cover the happy path plus the expected failures (invalid input, not found, conflict, unauthorized).
- Import test helpers explicitly from `vitest` (no globals).

Run the tests and the typecheck before committing.

## Code Review

Review AI-generated code periodically, especially for:

- Security (auth checks, input validation)
- Performance (unnecessary re-renders, N+1 queries)
- Logic errors (edge cases)
- Patterns (matches existing codebase?)
